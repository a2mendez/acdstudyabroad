<p>ACD Study Abroad reserves the right to modify deadlines without prior notice.</p>

<p><strong>ACD Study Abroad deadlines do not necessarily coincide with deadlines to apply for a student visa.</strong> Depending on the program duration and/or the student’s nationality, a student visa may or may not be required. Student applicants are solely responsible for researching the visa requirements and securing a visa if required. ACD Study Abroad assumes no responsibility in the event that a student is unable to secure, or is denied, a student visa in time to participate in the program. Under such circumstances, the student will be subject to the ACD Study Abroad withdrawal and refund policy.</p>

<p><strong>Late Applications / Fees</strong><br>Applications received after the deadline will be considered only if space is available and/or if the student will have sufficient time to complete the required forms. <strong>Students submitting applications after the deadline may be subject to a late fee of $150.</strong> Applications are considered to be complete only after all required application materials are received. Students who submit the initial application but fail to submit the materials required to complete their application may also be subject to a late fee of $150.</p>

<P><b>Enrollment Forms</b><br>Upon the review of all required application materials, if it is determined that the student applicant meets the eligibility requirements, the ACD Study Abroad staff will approve the application.</p>

<P>

Once approved, accepted students will proceed to the enrollment process, which includes submitting the final payment and the following enrollment forms through the online student portal:
<ul>
<li><b>Flight Information and Itinerary:</b> Completed online by the student, the flight information gives ACD Study Abroad the details of the student’s arrival in Dublin. Students are also required to submit a copy of their flight itinerary issued by the airline for their flight to Dublin.</li>

<li><b>Health Information:</b> Completed online by the student, the health information form provides information pertaining to the student’s health as it relates to his/her participation.</li>

<li><b>Housing Contract:</b> Completed online by the student, the housing contract outlines the terms and conditions of the accommodations, as well as the assumption of responsibility the student accepts during his/her residence in Dublin.</li>

<li><b>Housing Questionnaire:</b> Completed online by the student, the questionnaire gives relevant details for ACD Study Abroad to better assign each student to his or her accommodation. Students may also request a roommate on the questionnaire.</li>

<li><b>Medical Authorization:</b> Completed and signed by a physician, the form certifies that the student is fit to participate in a study abroad program and provides relevant medical history and/or current medical conditions.</li>

<li><b>Passport Copy:</b> A scanned copy of the biographical page of the student’s valid passport must be uploaded to the online student portal. Passports must be valid for the duration of the student’s stay in Ireland.</li>

<li><b>Program Contract:</b> Completed online by the student, the program contract outlines the terms and conditions a student must abide by throughout the program, as well as the assumption of risk the student accepts during his/her participation on the program.</li>
</ul>
</P>

<p>
ACD Study Abroad may require students to complete additional forms during the admissions process.</p>

<p>Students are responsible for submitting all required enrollment forms and final payment by the posted deadline (see section titled <i>Application, Forms and Payment Deadlines)</i>. Failure to submit enrollment forms or make final payment by the deadline may result in automatic cancellation from the program. Under such circumstances, the student will be subject to the ACD Study Abroad withdrawal and refund policy.</p>

<p><b>Passport and Visas</b><br>All students participating in an ACD Study Abroad program are required to have a valid passport and a student visa (if applicable) for the duration of their stay in Ireland. Depending on the program duration and/or the student’s nationality, a student visa may or may not be required. ACD Study Abroad will provide official documentation confirming the student’s enrollment at American College Dublin and basic instructions for students to apply for a visa if required. Each student is solely responsible for researching the visa requirements and securing a visa in time for departure to Dublin.</p>

<p>ACD Study Abroad deadlines do not necessarily coincide with deadlines to apply for a student visa. ACD Study Abroad assumes no responsibility in the event that a student is unable to secure, or is denied, a student visa in time to participate in the program. Under such circumstances, the student will be subject to the ACD Study Abroad withdrawal and refund policy.</p>

<p><h3 class="acd-tile__title">Program Fees and Payment Policies</h3></p>

<p>Acceptance to and enrollment in all ACD Study Abroad programs are contingent upon the successful payment of all program-related fees. The failure of a student to meet his/her financial obligation by the published deadlines may result in automatic cancellation from the program. Under such circumstances, the student will be subject to the ACD Study Abroad withdrawal and refund policy.</p>

<p><b>Program Fees and Billing</b> (Lynn University)<br>American College Dublin partners with Lynn University in Boca Raton, Florida, USA. Lynn provides institutional relations, recruitment and payment processing for ACD Study Abroad programs. All program fees are in U.S. dollars and set by the ACD Study Abroad office at Lynn University. Questions regarding program fees must be addressed to the ACD Study Abroad staff at Lynn University, and not to the on-site staff in Dublin.</p>

<p>Billing for all ACD Study Abroad program costs is done by Lynn University. Invoices and account statements will indicate Lynn University, Inc. as the billing agent. Thus, <b>all payments must be made payable to Lynn University.</b></p>


  <p>Program fees and included goods and services are available at <a href="www.acdstudyabroad.com">www.acdstudyabroad.com</a>. Lynn University does not give refunds (or partial refunds) for goods and services included as part of ACD Study Abroad program fees that the student does not use.</p>
    
    <p>As the responsible institution for payment processing for ACD Study Abroad, Lynn University reserves the right to transfer to a collections agency any outstanding balance owed for ACD Study Abroad program fees billed to the student and not paid in full by the published deadlines (see section titled <i>Application, Forms and Payment Deadlines)</i>. All fees assessed to Lynn University related to the collection of a student’s outstanding balance will be the responsibility of the student.</p>
    
   <p> <b>Payment Methods</b><br><b> All payments for ACD Study Abroad program fees must be made payable to Lynn University in U.S. dollars.</b> Lynn University accepts a variety of convenient payment methods including check, money order, traveler’s check, cashier’s check, cash and credit card. Payments by credit card are made online at [INSERT URL]. All other payments (check, money order, cashier’s check, etc.) must be payable to Lynn University and mailed to:<p>
    
    <p>Lynn University Attn: <br>ACD Study Abroad <br>3601 N. Military Trail<br> Boca Raton, FL 33431</p>
    
    <p><b>Financial Aid and Deferral Form</b><br>The use of federal financial aid toward the ACD Study Abroad program fee is determined by, and applied for at, the student’s home university. It is the students’ responsibility to learn if the aid they receive is transferable to ACD Study Abroad, and what steps are required to apply for aid with an authorized financial aid advisor on their home campus.</p>
    
   <p> All students using financial aid toward the payment of their ACD Study Abroad program fees are required to complete the <b>Financial Aid Deferral</b> Form with their home university’s financial aid office and submit it to the ACD Study Abroad U.S. office at Lynn University by the final payment deadline (see section titled <i>Application, Forms and Payment Deadlines).</i></p>
    
    <p>Upon receipt of the Financial Aid Deferral Form, the portion of the program fee to be covered by financial aid will be deferred until the student’s verified disbursement date. Students are required to make payment of the financial aid disbursement to Lynn University for the remaining balance of their ACD Study Abroad program fee within fourteen (14) days of the disbursement date. In the event that financial aid funds are not received or disbursed by that date, students assume full responsibility for all program fees. Failure to make the payment within this period may result in automatic cancellation from the program. Under such circumstances, the student will be held liable for the outstanding balance of his/her program fees, which may be transferred to a collections agency.  <b>Additionally, all academic records may be withheld until the outstanding balance is paid in full.</b></p>
    
    <p><b>Outstanding On-Site Debts</b><br>In the event that ACD Study Abroad incurs a cost as a result of, or on behalf of, a student participant and the debt remains unpaid at the end of the program, ACD Study Abroad will bill the student in U.S. dollars from the U.S. office at Lynn University. All academic records may be withheld until the outstanding on-site debt is paid in full.</p>
    
    <p><b>Program Cancellation</b><br>ACD Study Abroad reserves the right to cancel or suspend a program if necessary. If a program is canceled, accepted students may (a) choose to enroll in a subsequent term or (b) receive a full refund of fees paid, less the program deposit. Should a student choose to enroll in a subsequent term, he/she is responsible for any additional financial obligations that may apply.</p>
    
    <p><b>Withdrawal and Refund Policy</b><br>The ACD Study Abroad withdrawal and refund policy applies to all withdrawals, regardless of the reason. All requests to withdraw must be submitted to ACD Study Abroad in writing. Verbal requests to withdraw will not be considered.</p>
    
    <p><b>Program Deposit:</b> All students are required to pay the $300 program deposit in order to submit the program application. <b>Once submitted, the $300 program deposit is non-refundable.</b></p>
    
    <p><b>Payment Deadline:</b> The payment deadline is determined by the term of the program that the student has applied for. All program deadlines are published on the ACD Study Abroad website. Generally, the payment deadline is thirty (30) days after the application deadline.</p>
    
    <p><b>Final Withdrawal Date:</b> The final withdrawal date for all ACD Study Abroad programs is fourteen (14) days before the program start date. No refunds will be processed for students who withdraw from their program on or after the final withdrawal date.</p>
    
   <p><b>Withdrawal Fees and Refunds:</b> Students who withdraw from the program are financially responsible for a withdrawal fee, plus any non-recoverable costs incurred by ACD Study Abroad through the date the written notification of withdrawal is received, as shown in the chart below. Any remaining funds after the withdrawal fee and non-recoverable costs are paid will be refunded to the student.</p>

   <p><h3 class="acd-tile__title">Academic Policies</h3></p>

<p>All students participating in a program with ACD Study Abroad are considered students of American College Dublin for the duration of their program. They are therefore subject to and responsible for complying with the academic policies of American College Dublin, in addition to the policies specific to ACD Study Abroad. It is the responsibility of the student to become familiar with these policies as well as the academic policies of his/her home institution that may apply to the student’s participation in the ACD Study Abroad program.</p>

<p><b>Course Load</b><br>
During the fall and spring semesters, the standard course load for ACD Study Abroad students consists of 15 U.S. semester-hour credits (22.5 quarter-hour credits), or five courses. Students wishing to take less than the standard course load may do so with authorization from ACD Study Abroad. To maintain full-time status, however, student are required to take a minimum of 12 U.S. semester-hour credits (18 quarter-hour credits), or four courses. Students wishing to take more than the standard course load may do so at an additional fee and with authorization from ACD Study Abroad. It is the student’s responsibility to understand the course load requirements of his/her home institution, including minimum requirements to qualify for financial aid.</p>

<p>During the short-term programs offered during the summer, course loads vary between 6 and 12 U.S. semester-hour credits (9 and 18 quarter-hour credits), or two and four courses. Students wishing to take more than the standard course load may do so at an additional fee and with authorization from ACD Study Abroad.</p>

<p><b>Course Credit and Equivalencies</b><br>Students applying to ACD Study Abroad must make their course selections for the corresponding program when completing their program application. ACD Study Abroad provides course syllabi for each available course at <a href="www.acdstudyabroad.com">www.acdstudyabroad.com</a>. It is the responsibility of the student to complete the necessary documentation his/her home institution requires to establish equivalencies for courses taken at American College Dublin. The amount of course credit and course equivalency for each course successfully completed by the student at American College Dublin is determined by the student’s home institution.</p>


<p>Additionally, students applying to ACD Study Abroad are required to have a Home School Authorization form completed by their study abroad office at their home institution. This authorization indicates whether or not the home institution agrees to accept American College Dublin’s transcript and grant credit to the student upon successful completion of the program, per the home institution’s credit evaluation policies and procedures.</p>

<p><b>ACD Study Abroad and American College Dublin assume no responsibility in the event that a student’s home institution refuses to accept coursework completed at American College Dublin.</b></p>

<p><b>Transcripts</b><br>

Upon the completion of each ACD Study Abroad program, all coursework and final examinations are evaluated by the faculty, and final grades are submitted to the Registrar at American College Dublin. Once the final grades are received, the Registrar will generate an official transcript from American College Dublin, to be sent to the home institution as indicated on the participating student’s ACD Study Abroad program application. Students can expect the official transcripts to be sent within 60 days of the program end date. In the event that a student has an outstanding balance or an on-site debt, <b>all academic records may be withheld until the outstanding balance is paid in full.</b></p>

<p>Students wishing to know the grades earned during the ACD Study Abroad program must request the information from their home institution. ACD Study Abroad does not release information pertaining to coursework and/or grades from American College Dublin over the phone or by email. If a student requires additional copies of his/her transcript, the student must complete the ACD Transcript Request Form and submit it to the ACD Study Abroad U.S. office at Lynn University. ACD Study Abroad will accept additional transcript requests from students only. No other individual is authorized to make a request.</p>

<p><b>Attendance</b><br>

Students participating in the ACD Study Abroad program are expected to attend all scheduled classes and required field studies and/or excursions throughout the program. Regular and punctual attendance is essential to successful academic achievement. Each student is responsible for all work from the first day of the course and must make satisfactory arrangements with the faculty regarding any absences. The attendance policy and how it factors into the student’s academic performance in the course is determined by the faculty and set out in the course syllabus. It is the responsibility of the student to be aware of the attendance policy for each course in which he or she is enrolled. A student may have non-attendance excused on documented medical grounds. It is the responsibility of the student to notify ACD within five working days of any ongoing medical condition that prevents attendance and to submit relevant documentation within five working days of returning to class.</p>

<p>ACD Study Abroad students from outside the European Union (EU) should also be aware that the current government requirement to maintain a student visa is that a non-EU student should attend at least 85 percent of his or her classes. In the case of a non-EU student seeking an official enrollment letter from American College Dublin for an application to extend his/her student visa, the College is obliged to report in the letter the percentage of classes the student has attended.</p>

<p><b>Add/Drop</b><br>

Students participating in the ACD Study Abroad program have the option to make changes to their course registration during the same add/drop period as American College Dublin degree-seeking students. Students wishing to add/drop a course must do so within the first week of classes. After this week, a student must receive the permission of the Registrar. Additionally, ACD Study Abroad students must have the written permission of their study abroad office (advisor) or appropriate authority from their home institution in order to add/drop a course. Course equivalencies established by the student’s home institution that are affected by changes to the student’s course registration during the add/drop period are the responsibility of the student.</p>

<p>All ACD Study Abroad students are required to maintain the minimum course load throughout the program. Students wishing to take more than the standard course load may do so at an additional fee and with authorization from ACD Study Abroad (see the section titled <i>Course Load</i>).</p>

<p><b>Course Withdrawal Policy</b><br>

Following the add/drop period, if an ACD Study Abroad student wishes to withdraw from a course, he/she must discuss the circumstances with the Registrar, complete the appropriate withdrawal form and obtain the necessary authorization signatures. Authorization to withdraw from a course may be contingent upon the student maintaining the minimum course load for the duration of the program (see the section titled <i>Course Load</i>). Additionally, it is the student’s responsibility to understand the course load requirements of his/her home institution, including minimum requirements to qualify for financial aid, before withdrawing from a course. Under no circumstances is a student who withdraws from a course eligible for a refund (or partial refund).</p>

<p><b>Cancellation of Courses</b><br>American College Dublin reserves the right to cancel any course for which an insufficient number of students has enrolled, or for any other reasons deemed necessary. No charge is made to a student for a registration change necessitated by such a cancellation.</p>


<p><h3 class="acd-tile__title">Code of Conduct</h3></p>

<p>All students admitted to an ACD Study Abroad program are considered students of American College Dublin for the duration of their program. They therefore are subject to and responsible for complying with the code of conduct of American College Dublin, in addition to the policies specific to ACD Study Abroad. The code of conduct, program policies and guidelines will be reviewed in detail with all students by ACD Study Abroad staff during the on-site orientation in Dublin at the start of the program. It is the responsibility of the student to become familiar with the code of conduct, program policies and guidelines as well as the conduct policies of his/her home institution that may apply to the student’s participation in the ACD Study Abroad program.</p>

<p><b>Authoritative Bodies</b><br>

ACD Study Abroad views its students as responsible adults and expects that they will act with the requisite maturity and responsibility at all times, on and off campus, throughout the duration of the program. Study-abroad students are enrolled at American College Dublin and are subject to the provisions of the code of conduct, program policies and guidelines to the same extent as degree-seeking students. Any student who engages in conduct that violates the code of conduct, program policies or guidelines will be subject to review and sanctions, including, where appropriate, dismissal from the program.</p>

<p>Students participating in the ACD Study Abroad program are required to abide by the laws and customs of Ireland. Students are legally subject to the same laws and regulations that govern Irish citizens, as well as any other laws that are applicable as a foreign citizen in Ireland.</p>

<p>Students must acknowledge and accept that ACD Study Abroad personnel and/or the personnel of American College Dublin have the authority at all times to establish rules of conduct necessary for the operation of the program, which includes students’ free time. Students are subject to any disciplinary action deemed appropriate by ACD Study Abroad personnel and/or the personnel of American College Dublin, which may include but is not limited to dismissal from the program and/or the loss of academic credit. Information regarding students who violate ACD Study Abroad policies or the policies of American College Dublin may be released to their home institution and/or their parents/legal guardians.</p>

<p>Acts of Dishonesty

Students are expected to refrain from actions that may be deemed dishonest, including, but not limited to:
<ul>
<li>providing false information, withholding relevant information, or supplying misleading information;</li>

<li>forgery, alteration, or use of documents or instruments of identification with the intent to defraud;</li>

<li>refusing to provide identification, misidentifying oneself or presenting a false identification;</li>

<li>making a false or misleading oral or written statement that misrepresents the character, qualifications, or reputation of another;</li>

<li>possessing any form of false identification.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Alcohol and Drug Policy</b><br>

ACD Study Abroad does not consider the use of alcoholic beverages as necessary to the process of higher education. Inappropriate behavior resulting from alcohol consumption and/or abuse is a serious violation of ACD Study Abroad regulations. The use or abuse of alcohol is not an acceptable excuse for any violation of ACD Study Abroad or American College Dublin policies.
<ul>
<li>Persons under the legal drinking age may not distribute, sell, possess, consume or be under the influence of alcohol.</li>

<li>Persons of legal drinking age may not distribute, provide or sell alcohol to persons under the legal drinking age.</li>

<li>Use or possession of false or altered identification, or other misrepresentation of one’s age in order to possess, consume or purchase alcohol, is prohibited.</li>

<li>Public intoxication, excessive noise, verbal or physical abuse to others and vandalism will not be tolerated.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>ACD Study Abroad does not support any activity related to the possession, use, provision of or sale of any illegal substance. The possession, use or sharing of drugs may result in dismissal from the program. This dismissal will occur regardless of legal action. The illegal possession, use or sharing of prescription drugs is a violation of ACD Study Abroad policy and may result in dismissal from the program. The selling of drugs deemed illegal in Ireland, including marijuana and prescription drugs, may result in immediate dismissal and in the notification of the proper law enforcement authorities.</p>

<p>Students are further cautioned that the possession of drugs is often dealt with harshly by local, Irish law enforcement. Neither ACD Study Abroad nor the U.S. Embassy can obtain release from jail.</p>

<p><b>Harm to Others</b><br>

ACD Study Abroad students are required to respect the rights of others. The following behaviors relevant to the safety and security of others are prohibited:
<ul>

<li>Assault</li>

<li>Bullying</li>

<li>Discrimination and Harassment</li>

<li>Harassing Behavior</li>

<li>Hate Incidents</li>

<li>Sexual Assault</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Endangerment</b><br>

ACD Study Abroad expects its students not to engage in behaviors that threaten or endanger the health and/or safety of themselves or others. In addition, students are expected to reasonably care for their own mental and physical well-being. If circumstances arise that prohibit a student from appropriately assessing or attending to his or her own welfare, the student is strongly encouraged to seek counseling and support. In such cases, the student is expected to abide by reasonable directives offered by a professional.</p>

<p><b>Improper Off-Campus Behavior</b><br>

Off-campus incidents involving alleged violations of local law are subject to conduct review. In addition, a student’s off-campus behavior that negatively affects the mission or reputation of ACD Study Abroad and/or American College Dublin is subject to conduct review.</p>

<P><b>Tampering with Property</b><br>

Tampering with property is a violation of ACD Study Abroad and American College Dublin policy and includes but is not limited to attempted or actual:
<ul>

<li>Theft</li>

<li>Illegal possession</li>

<li>Misuse</li>

<li>Destruction</li>

<li>Damage</li>

<li>Harm</li>
</ul>


<p><h3 class="acd-tile__title">Disciplinary Process</h3></p>

In the event that a student is found to be in violation of ACD Study Abroad and/or American College Dublin policy, the code of conduct, established program guidelines/expectations and/or local laws, the Dean of Students and on-site staff will perform a conduct review following the established protocols.</p>

<p><b>Sanctions</b>

Depending on the nature and severity of the violation and/or other factors, the following sanctions may be applied:</p>

<p><b>Verbal Warning:</b> A verbal warning is meant to address a first offense in which a minor behavioral incident violates the code of conduct and/or established program guidelines/expectations.</p>

<p><b>Written Warning:</b> A written warning is meant to address (a) a second offense of a minor behavioral incident or (b) a major behavioral incident that violates the code of conduct and/or established program guidelines/expectations. The written warning outlines the “Expected Behavior” and “Loss of Privileges” for the student moving forward and the consequences if the expectations are not met.</p>


<p><b>Loss of Privileges:</b> Access to on-site facilities, the right to live in ACD Study Abroad-arranged housing, participation in program activities and/or excursions and/or other goods and services may be restricted as the result of a violation of the code of conduct and/or established program guidelines/expectations. Students are not eligible for refunds (or partial refunds) for restricted goods and services resulting from disciplinary action.</p>

<p><b>Restitution:</b> In the event that a student causes damages to or loss of personal property, whether or not as a result of a violation of the code of conduct and/or established program guidelines/expectations, the student is responsible for repayment to the affected individual and/or organization.</p>

<p><b>Program Dismissal:</b> ACD Study Abroad reserves the right to dismiss any student at any time who fails to adhere to the policies, terms and conditions of ACD Study Abroad and/or American College Dublin. Dismissal from the program can result from (a) a third offense of a minor behavioral incident, (b) a second offense of a major behavioral incident or (c) a severe behavioral incident requiring immediate dismissal that violates the code of conduct, established program guidelines/expectations and/or local laws.</p>

<p><b>Consequences of Dismissal</b><br>

Dismissal from the ACD Study Abroad program shall not diminish or otherwise affect a student’s obligation to make any and all payments. Dismissed students may receive a grade of “F” (Failure) in all course work in progress (at the discretion of the faculty and/or the Academic Dean). In addition, the student will not be entitled to a refund of fees, may be required to reimburse his/her home university for financial aid received, and is responsible for all non‐recoverable costs incurred by ACD Study Abroad and/or American College Dublin, as well as personal financial obligations.</p>

<p>With the exception of immediate dismissal, the ACD Study Abroad on-site staff may give a dismissed student several days to leave the program, vacate the housing and arrange for transportation home. Additionally, upon being dismissed from the program, a student’s visa may become invalid, requiring the student to leave the country or risk immigration violations.</p>

<p><b>Notification</b><br>

The Dean of Students and on-site staff may share details concerning the violation of the code of conduct and/or established program guidelines/expectations and the resulting sanctions with the following:<br>
<ul>

<li>ACD Study Abroad and/or American College Dublin on-site staff</li>
